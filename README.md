# BiometrAfrica Demo Platform

## Overview
BiometrAfrica Demo is a comprehensive biometric data management platform designed to showcase advanced biometric capabilities for African markets. This platform demonstrates secure collection, storage, and verification of biometric data while maintaining high standards of data privacy and security.

## Purpose and Scope
The platform serves as a demonstration of biometric solutions tailored for:
- Identity verification
- Secure authentication
- Digital onboarding
- Access control systems
- Financial services integration

## Features
- Biometric data capture and verification
- Real-time face matching
- Fingerprint authentication
- Secure data storage and encryption
- API integration capabilities
- User management system
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging and monitoring

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React.js, TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT
- Biometric Processing: Custom algorithms
- Cloud Infrastructure: AWS

## How It Works
1. **User Registration**
   - Captures basic user information
   - Collects biometric data (facial/fingerprint)
   - Encrypts and stores data securely

2. **Authentication**
   - Multi-factor authentication support
   - Biometric verification process
   - Token-based session management

3. **Data Management**
   - Secure storage with encryption
   - Access control mechanisms
   - Data privacy compliance
